	"Nestled between the Pacific Ocean and the Santa Ynez mountains and only a day trip from Los Angeles, its natural beauty and historic architecture have been protected for nearly two centuries. With its year-round Mediterranean climate, this central California coastal port is a relaxing rendezvous." - Downtown Organization of Santa Barbara, Inc
